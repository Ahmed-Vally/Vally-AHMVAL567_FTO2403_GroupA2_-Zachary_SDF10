## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

An API (application programming interface) is a software Middleman (so to speak) that allows to applications to speak to each other it allows one to extract and share data too and from organizations. I have recently used the spotify Build in API that was taught to us via the freecodecamp video. 

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

An interface is a point where two things meet and interact. And an API is an interface with a specific set of instructions tied to it.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

Web APIs let you interact with browsers You write code on your computer and the correct thing will happen magically on a userâ€™s browser.

 Rest APIs let browsers and servers interact with other browsers and servers . Browser A sends a request, and Server B responds. Browser A magically knows how to interpret this response.

 I find the RESTful API to be more useful Because I feel like it has alot more uses nowadays where we want almost everything to interact with each other and get a valid response.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

I have mostly used Curl and I'm hopping to get into more libraries so learn more.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

I feel confident in the use of the most of the API tools and libraries, but I struggle to read what is happening and when an error appears it takes me a while to understand what is wrong .

To improve on the skill I struggle with I will have to watch a few videos and do more projects that I don't feel comfortable with
